## Use case: Scale down zero

1. Create deployment of 10 replicas
```
oc apply -f hello-world.yaml
```

2. Increase load on application

3. Show need for autoscaling

4. Create HPA and modified deployment with spec.replicas removed
```
oc apply -f hpa1.yaml
```

5. Observe error (all pods are terminated)

6. HPA should bring the pods back up with the load but we will see a spike in error requests
```
watch oc get pods
```

Note: `deploymentConfig` without replicas sets the count to 0.  `deployment` without replicas sets the count to 1.

7. Fix: Don't remove the spec.replicas field.  You don't need to modify it.
```
oc delete -f hpa1.yaml
oc apply -f hello-world.yaml
oc apply -f hpa2.yaml
```
